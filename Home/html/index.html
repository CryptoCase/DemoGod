  <div class="creation">
    <h3>How are states created?</h3>
    <p>Manipulative and coercive human behavior is enabled by the centralizing tendencies of currencies as determined by game theory analysis.</p>
    <p>Say there are 1000 people. These people will naturally want to craft and trade resources. How can this be done? They could barter as there is no adopted currency. Barter is ineffective as a means of trade for numerous reasons. So the 1000
      people decide to set up a currency to promote better trade. Great, but how?</p>

    <p>Well each person could form a private bank, and create a supply of notes to represent the value of their resources. A problem arises quickly when each bank creates more supply to buy other resources while simultaneously devaluing everyone
      else's holdings. Not only that, but each person will have to account for all these different types of notes, and what each different notes value is. There is a network effect of money, and people will gravitate towards one spoken language of
      transacting with each other. There is also the supply and demand characteristics, which introduces volatility. Supply and demand pulled by the network effect creates a centralizing tendency for currencies.</p>

    <p>This currency centralization due to the network effect and supply and demand provides opportunity for the central issuer of currency to form a government. Coercive human behavior is enabled in this monopolistic situation. The ability to
      manipulate a currency for gain is inevitable, as is the consequential ability to hire soldiers, set up organizations, then enact laws to manipulate individuals for gain.</p>

    <h3>Why do states always grow?</h3>
    <p>Initially through inflation, later on through taxation as well.

      Due to inflation and the hired army, the government has a monopoly on violence. This monopoly on violence is used by everyone who can use it to further their self interests. Individuals who want businesses or people controlled? The government
      will be happy to expand and control it by using more of your money. Businesses will use it to stifle competition and consumer choices. Politicians will use it to give them more control and money by making deals with businesses, appealing to
      voters, and advocating for more expansion and control. Shrinking government is irrational to those running the government, as they stand to lose.</p>

  <div class="failure">

    <p>Hyper-inflation, wars, growing agencies and influence over the population, reduction in productivity and value creation.</p>
